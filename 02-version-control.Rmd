If you're writing code, it's very important to implement version control with Git. This guide will get you started!


First you'll need to [install Git](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/).

Next, create an account on [Github](https://github.com). If you want access to provate repositories (i.e. if you need to backup unpublished data or code), be sure to set up a student account.

Now, you'll need to set your credentials in Git. Open up your terminal.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#set your user name on github
git config --global user.name "John Doe"

#set your user email on github
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Now, go to Github and create a repository for your code. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-1.png")
```


If you want this repository to be private, change the repo settings on Githib. Click on the settings button.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-2.png")
```

Then set the reposotory to private.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-3.png")
```

Then clone this repository to your computer. You may be prompted to enter your Github password.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#change directories to the desired location for your repository
cd ~/Desktop

#clone your repository using the URL 
git clone https://github.com/OsburnLab/Protocols
```

Now you can add your code files to this cloned repository. When you're done editing your code, push it up to the Github server.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
#add your new files to the queue
git add .

#commit your changes and add a short description
git commit -a -m "short description here"

#push your changes to the Github server
git push 
```
